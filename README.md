# neural_package
A customized package with theano backend that adopts many design ideas from pytorch

For now, there are two sub-packages:
- nn package: nn modules for faster model development
  [TODO] RNN (cudnn version & scan version)
- datautils: data iterators, data readers, and common Vision and Text datasets
  [TODO] Image file reader, Text common datasets
